# AI Orchestration Workspace

You are operating in an AI orchestration workspace that coordinates multiple specialized actors through a director system. This workspace follows a flat git submodule architecture to support complex AI systems with proper task delegation, quality control, and deployment management.

## Workspace Overview

**Architecture**: Flat git submodule structure with all components as siblings
**Director**: Primary orchestrator that manages tasks and coordinates actors
**Actors**: Domain-specific AI instances that handle specialized tasks independently
**Communication**: Shared workspace and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
**Configuration**: Directors and actors manage their own configurations independently

## Workspace Structure

```
workspace/                      # Your current location (workspace root)
├── CLAUDE.md                  # This file - workspace instructions
├── .claude/                   # Claude configuration (auto-generated)
├── .mcp.json                  # MCP configuration (generated by director, gitignored)
├── [director-name]/           # Director orchestrator (git submodule)
│   ├── .env                  # Director's configuration
│   ├── nx.json               # Nx workspace configuration
│   ├── prompts/              # Orchestration guides
│   ├── apps/mcp/cli_use/     # Director MCP server
│   └── scripts/              # Automation tools
├── [actor-1]/                 # Specialized actor (git submodule)
├── [actor-2]/                 # Another actor (git submodule)
├── [actor-3]/                 # Another actor (git submodule)
└── [your-actors]/            # Additional actors as needed
```

**Important**: 
- The workspace root is Claude's entry point
- Directors and actors are independent with their own configurations
- Each component manages its own environment as needed

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Workspace

```bash
# Clone this workspace template
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-workspace]
cd [your-workspace]

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Create Director

```bash
# Copy director boilerplate
cp -r director_boilerplate [your-director-name]
cd [your-director-name]

# Initialize as your own repository
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from director_boilerplate"

# Create GitHub repository
gh repo create [your-org]/[your-director-name] --private
git push -u origin main

# Add as submodule to workspace
cd ..
git submodule add https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-director-name] [your-director-name]

# Run environment setup
cd [your-director-name] && ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

### 3. Add Actors

```bash
# Copy actor boilerplate
cp -r actor_boilerplate my-actor
cd my-actor

# Customize for your domain
# Edit CLAUDE.md, package.json, etc.

# Initialize and push
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from actor_boilerplate"
gh repo create [your-org]/my-actor --private
git push -u origin main

# Add to workspace
cd ..
git submodule add https://github.com/[your-org]/my-actor my-actor
```

## Key Concepts

### Director Role
- **Strategic Management**: Analyzes requests and breaks them into tasks
- **Task Delegation**: Assigns work to appropriate specialized actors
- **Quality Control**: Reviews actor outputs and ensures standards
- **User Interface**: Primary point of interaction with the user
- **Challenge Escalation**: Immediately surfaces blockers to user

### Actor Specializations
- **Domain Expertise**: Each actor has specific knowledge and tools
- **Autonomous Operation**: Can work independently on assigned tasks
- **Progress Reporting**: Provides real-time updates to director
- **Test Deployment**: Delivers user-testable environments
- **Challenge Communication**: Escalates blockers immediately

### Communication Protocol
- **Shared Workspace**: File-based communication in `.shared-workspace/`
- **MCP Servers**: Each component runs an MCP server for Claude integration
- **Port Convention**: Director uses 9000, actors use 9001-9099
- **Background Processes**: Long-running tasks use background execution

## Best Practices

### Workspace Management
1. **Flat Structure**: Keep all submodules as siblings at workspace root
2. **Independent Repos**: Each component is its own git repository
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Director orchestrates, actors implement
4. **Version Control**: Use git submodules for component versioning

### Development Workflow
1. **Director First**: Set up director before adding actors
2. **Incremental Growth**: Add actors as needed for new domains
3. **Test Locally**: Verify communication before deployment
4. **Document Everything**: Keep CLAUDE.md files updated

### Communication Patterns
1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Respond to tasks quickly
2. **Progress Updates**: Report status every 5-10 minutes
3. **Challenge Escalation**: Surface blockers immediately
4. **Structured Responses**: Use consistent formatting

## Common Commands

### Director Operations
```bash
cd director
./scripts/setup-environment.sh     # Configure environment
npx nx run pm:executor:universal-config-from-template --template=.mcp.template.json --output=.mcp.json   # Generate MCP config
npx nx serve                       # Start director MCP server
```

### Actor Management
```bash
cd my-actor
./scripts/setup-environment.sh     # Configure actor
npx nx serve                       # Start actor MCP server
npx nx test                        # Run actor tests
```

### Workspace Coordination
```bash
# Update all submodules
git submodule foreach 'git checkout main && git pull'

# Check submodule status
git submodule status

# Start full system
cd director && npx nx run director:start-orchestration
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Setup
1. **Node.js**: v18 or higher
2. **Python**: 3.8+ with uv package manager
3. **Git**: For submodule management
4. **Claude**: Desktop or API access

### MCP Configuration
The director generates `.mcp.json` at workspace root. This file configures Claude's access to all MCP servers in the system.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure each component uses a unique port
- **Path errors**: Run setup scripts to detect environment
- **Submodule issues**: Use `git submodule update --init`
- **MCP connection**: Verify `.mcp.json` generation

### Getting Help
1. Check component README files
2. Review prompts/ directories for guides
3. Examine boilerplate examples
4. Use web search for latest practices

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit**: `.env`, `.mcp.json`, credentials
- **Use .gitignore**: Ensure sensitive files are excluded
- **Environment variables**: Store secrets in `.env` files
- **Access control**: Configure MCP security appropriately

Remember: This workspace template provides the foundation. Your unique value comes from the specialized actors and orchestration logic you build!
